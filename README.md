Random Ubuntu Scripts
These should work with debian and other debian-based distros

If you need a VPS, I highly recommend DigitalOcean. They have plans starting at just $5 a month, and you get **$10 of credit** simply by signing up with [this link](https://m.do.co/c/f941d4888bfb). Using that link also helps me pay for my DigitalOcean VPS's, so it's a win-win(free credit for everyone!).
